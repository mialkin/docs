The **Secure Shell** or **SSH** is a cryptographic network protocol for operating network services securely over an unsecured network.

## SSH client

### List existing SSH keys

```bash
ls -al ~/.ssh
```

### Generate new pair of keys

```bash
cd ~/.ssh
ssh-keygen -f github
ssh-keygen -f gitlab
ssh-keygen -f gitflic
```

If using multiple SSH keys don't forget to [set the right](#use-multiple-keys).

### Get public key

Copy public key into clipboard:

```bash
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | pbcopy
```

### Copy public key to server

```bash
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub remote_username@remote_host
# Then try to authenticate via SSH:
# ssh remote_username@remote_host
```

This logs into the server host, and copies keys to the server, and configures them to grant access by adding them to the `authorized_keys` file. The copying may ask for a password or other authentication for the server.

Only the public key is copied to the server. The private key should never be copied to another machine.

After that connect to server and make sure that your public key was added there:

```bash
cat ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

### Connect to server

If you have multiple privates keys, specify the one to use:

```bash
ssh -i path_to_private_key_file remote_username@remote_host
#ssh -i path_to_private_key_file remote_username@remote_hos -p SSH_PORT
```

This command assumes that your username on the remote system is the same as your username on your local system:

```bash
ssh remote_host
```

If your username is different on the remote system, you can specify it by using this syntax:

```bash
ssh remote_username@remote_host
```

To exit back into your local session, simply type:

```bash
exit
```

You can create an alias to connect quicker:

```bash
echo "alias mysite='ssh mywebsite.abcd'" >> ~/.zshrc
```

### `known_hosts` file

Path to `known_hosts` file:

```bash
vim ~/.ssh/known_hosts
```

### Use multiple keys

```bash
cd
touch .ssh/config
vim .ssh/config
```

Contents of the file:

```text
Host github github.com
    HostName github.com
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/github
    User mialkin

Host gitlab gitlab.com
    HostName gitlab.com
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/gitlab
    User mialkin

Host handy_server
    HostName 10.11.12.13
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/handy
    IdentitiesOnly yes
    User handy_user
    Port 22
```

## SSH server

### Disable password authentication

On client:

```bash
ssh-copy-id aleksei@192.168.0.44
# ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/your-key.pub aleksei@192.168.0.44
```

On server:

```bash
sudo vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config
# sudo vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/50-cloud-init.conf
```

Set:

```text
PasswordAuthentication no
```

Run:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart ssh
```

### Change SSH port

If you want to change the default SSH port in Ubuntu, perform the following steps with root privileges:

Open the `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` file:

```bash
sudo vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

and locate the line:

```text
#Port 22
```

Then uncomment it by removing the leading`#` character and change the value with an appropriate port number for example, 22000:

```text
Port 22000
```

Restart the SSH server:

```bash
systemctl restart sshd
```

When connecting to the server using the ssh command, you need to specify the port to connect using the `-p` flag:

```bash
ssh remote_username@remote_host -p SSH_PORT_NUMBER
```

### List failed SSH login attempts

```bash
grep "Failed password" /var/log/auth.log
```
