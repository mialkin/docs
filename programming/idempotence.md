# Idempotence. Safe and idempotent HTTP methods

An **idempotence** is the property that an operation may be applied multiple times with the result not differing from the first application.

A typical crosswalk button is an example of an idempotent system.

## Safe and idempotent HTTP methods

A **safe HTTP method** is a HTTP method that doesn't alter the state of the server. In other words, a method is safe if it leads to a read-only operation. All safe methods are also _idempotent_, but not all idempotent methods are safe.

An **idempotent HTTP method** is a HTTP method that can be called many times without causing unintended side effects.

| ----------- | ---- | ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **POST**    | ❌   | ❌         | Use `POST` to create a new resource                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **PATCH**   | ❌   | ✅ / ❌    | A PATCH is not necessarily idempotent, although it can be. Contrast this with `PUT`; which is always idempotent. For example if an auto-incrementing counter field is an integral part of the resource, then a `PUT` will naturally overwrite it, since it overwrites everything, but not necessarily so for `PATCH`                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **PUT**     | ❌   | ✅         | Use `PUT` to modify a resource. `PUT` updates the entire resource with data that is passed in the body payload. If there is no resource that matches the request, it will create a new resource. With `PUT` you need to pass in data to update the entire resource, even if you only want to modify one field. If you just want to update part of your resource, you still need to send in data for the entire resource when you make a `PUT` request. The better-suited option here would be `PATCH` |
| **DELETE**  | ❌   | ✅         | Deletes the specified resource                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| **GET**     | ✅   | ✅         | Use `GET` to retrieve data from the server                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **HEAD**    | ✅   | ✅         | Similar to `GET` but returns only headers, no body.
